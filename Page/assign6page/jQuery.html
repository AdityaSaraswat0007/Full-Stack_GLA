        JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the
        client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages
        interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and
        style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that
        engage a user. Common examples of JavaScript that you might use every
        day include the search box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The
        New York Times, or refreshing your Twitter feed. Incorporating
        JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting it
        from a static page into an interactive one. To recap, JavaScript adds
        behavior to web pages
