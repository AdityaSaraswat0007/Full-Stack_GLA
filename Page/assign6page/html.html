        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely
        used language to write Web Pages. Hypertext refers to the way in which
        Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available
        on a webpage is called Hypertext. As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup
        Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document
        with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.
        Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure
        of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to
        facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.
